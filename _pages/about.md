## About me
Weikang (Zachary) is a second-year Ph.D. candidate (2023-) at [SMULL Group](https://cszhengzhang.cn/SMULL/) of [HITsz CS](http://cs.hitsz.edu.cn) advised by Prof. [Zheng Zhang](https://cszhengzhang.cn/). 
He received his B.S. degree in Information and Computational Science at [Harbin Institute of Technology](https://www.hit.edu.cn/) in 2023. 
His research interests lie in efficient training and inference algorithms for large-scale foundation models, particularly linear attentions.

This work presented a novel attention mechanism with linear complexity called PolaFormer. Our PolaFormer computed the similarity in a polarity-aware form to avoid neglecting negatives, at the same time, we theoretically proposed a familty of element-wise functions to make the attention weight more spiky and employ a learnable power function for simplicity and rescaling.
